This is a visualization that shows how Senators have voted on various bills.

The visualization uses the [ProPublica Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) and D3 (v3).

I plan on creating a wider list of bills, categorized by issues (eg, "Healthcare") for future iterations.
